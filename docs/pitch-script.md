### Opening Hook

"What if the quality of predictions mattered as much as the quantity?"

Prediction markets are powerful tools for aggregating information, but they have a problem: not all predictors are created equal. A fresh account with no track record has the same influence as a seasoned forecaster. RepMarket changes that.

---

### Core Concept

RepMarket is a reputation-weighted prediction market built on Ethos Network. We combine the collective intelligence of prediction markets with the trust signals of Web3 reputation systems.

When you make a prediction on RepMarket, two things happen:

1. Your stake contributes to the **raw odds** - the simple aggregate of all predictions
2. Your stake is also **weighted by your Ethos credibility** - the more credible you are, the more your prediction moves the weighted odds

This creates a fascinating divergence. When raw odds show 60% YES but weighted odds show 75% YES, that's a signal - the more reputable predictors are seeing something differently than the crowd.

### Anti-Sybil Protection

But reputation isn't just for weighting. It's also our first line of defense against manipulation.

Users with an Ethos credibility score below 800 are in the "Untrusted" tier - they can browse markets, build their reputation on Ethos, but they cannot place predictions. This prevents anonymous accounts from gaming the system.

As you build reputation on Ethos Network - through vouches, reviews, and consistent good behavior - you unlock higher stake limits:

- **Neutral (1000+):** Up to 100 stake per market
- **Established (1200+):** Up to 200 stake
- **Reputable (1400+):** Up to 300 stake
- And higher tiers unlock even more

### Key Features

**Multi-Position Trading:** Unlike binary bet-it-and-forget-it platforms, you can add to your position or exit early at market prices. Changed your mind? Sell your position before resolution.

**Autonomous Resolution:** Markets resolve automatically using objective data sources. Price markets check CoinGecko and Coinbase. TVL markets query DeFiLlama. No human intervention, no disputes - just verifiable data and transparent resolution.

**RepScore Evolution:** Your RepScore starts from your Ethos score but evolves independently based on your prediction performance. Win predictions, gain RepScore. Lose predictions, lose RepScore. Your reputation on RepMarket reflects your forecasting ability.
